# GPTZero Plugin for Verint Community

## Overview

The GPTZero Plugin integrates Verint Community with [GPTZero](https://gptzero.me/), a tool designed to detect AI-generated text. This plugin automatically scans new content created in the community and flags it as abusive if it determines that the text was likely generated by an AI model (like ChatGPT).

## Features

*   **Automated AI Detection**: Scans new content (posts, comments, etc.) immediately after creation.
*   **Abuse Flagging**: Automatically flags content as abusive if the probability of it being AI-generated exceeds a configurable threshold.
*   **Configurable Sensitivity**: Allows you to set the probability threshold to balance between catching AI content and avoiding false positives.

## Configuration

Navigate to **Control Panel > System > Plugins > 4 Roads - GPTZero Checker** to configure the plugin.

### Options

*   **API Key**: Your API key from GPTZero. You will need to sign up for an account at [gptzero.me](https://gptzero.me/) to obtain this.
*   **Probability Threshold**: A decimal value between 0 and 1 representing the probability threshold. If GPTZero returns a `completely_generated_prob` score higher than this value, the content will be flagged. (Default: `0.8`)

## How it Works

1.  **Content Creation**: When a user creates new content (e.g., a forum thread, reply, or blog post), the plugin intercepts the `AfterCreate` event.
2.  **API Request**: It extracts the text from the content and sends it to the GPTZero API (`https://api.gptzero.me/v2/predict/text`).
3.  **Analysis**: GPTZero analyzes the text and returns a probability score indicating how likely it is that the text was entirely generated by AI.
4.  **Action**:
    *   The plugin compares the returned probability score against your configured **Probability Threshold**.
    *   If the score is higher than the threshold, the content is marked as "Abusive" in Verint Community.
    *   This typically hides the content (depending on your moderation settings) and places it in the moderation queue for review.

## Troubleshooting

*   **Event Log**: Errors during the API call (e.g., network issues, invalid API key) are logged to the Verint Community Event Log with the category "Error" and message starting with "Abuse checking for GPTZero Plugin Failed".
